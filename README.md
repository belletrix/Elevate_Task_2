## 🔍 Project Title:

**Phishing Email Detection and Analysis**

---

## 🧾 Objective:

The aim of this task is to analyze a phishing email to identify suspicious elements such as forged sender addresses, malicious URLs, unsafe attachments, and social engineering tactics. This report demonstrates practical phishing detection techniques using simulated analysis tools and reporting formats.

## 📂 Files Included:

1. phishing_sample.txt` – Sample phishing email content.
2. phishing_email_analysis_report.docx` – Full report with details on sender, links, attachment, tone, and indicators.
3. Screenshot of header analysis using MxToolbox.
4. Screenshot of simulated link analysis using VirusTotal.
5. Screenshot of simulated attachment analysis using VirusTotal.
6. README.txt` – This file.

## 🛠️ Tools Used (Simulated or Actual):

* [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) – To scan URLs and attachments.
* [MxToolbox Email Header Analyzer](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx) – For header analysis (simulated).
* Notepad or Text Editor – To create sample phishing content.
* Microsoft Word – To prepare final report.
* ChatGPT – For guidance and simulation support.

## 🧪 Steps Performed:

1. Created a sample phishing email mimicking a real attack (PayPal spoof).
2. Simulated email header analysis.
3. Checked the sender’s domain for legitimacy.
4. Analyzed the suspicious URL using VirusTotal.
5. Evaluated the attached `.zip` file as potentially malicious.
6. Examined the tone and content of the message for phishing signals.
7. Summarized findings in a structured report.

## 📌 Key Learning:

This project highlights how attackers exploit trust, urgency, and technical mimicry in phishing attempts. Simple inspection of URLs, domains, tone, and headers can reveal malicious intent even when AV tools don’t flag the content.
